### Introduction

In this project, we have implemented a neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy. The neural network architecture consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. We have used the backpropagation algorithm to train the network by optimizing the weights and biases to minimize the loss function.

### Features

1. Implementation of a feedforward neural network

2. Backpropagation algorithm for training the neural network

3. Support for one hidden layers and customizable activation functions

4. Classification task with customizable number of output classes

5. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy.

### Intallation

To use the neural network implementation, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Nguinabe3/Neural_Network_From_Scratch.git

2. Navigate to the project directory in your computer

3. Run the Neural_Network.py file
